# Eth-Splitter

You will create a smart contract named Splitter whereby:
- there are 3 people: Alice, Bob and Carol.
- we can see the balance of the Splitter contract on the Web page.
- whenever Alice sends ether to the contract for it to be split, half of it goes to Bob and the other half to Carol.
- we can see the balances of Alice, Bob and Carol on the Web page.
- Alice can use the Web page to split her ether.
